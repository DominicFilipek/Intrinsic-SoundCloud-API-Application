Intrinsic SoundCloud API Application
====================================

Intrinsic SoundCloud Application

    • Title: Intrinsic SoundCloud App
    • Website Type: JavaScript, SC API, HTML5, CSS3, Backbone, Underscore

Project Requirements:

This was the final project of my advanced scripting course. There were many specific requirements for this project that were mostly oriented with JavaScript features and dynamic API usage. The purpose of the project is to utilize a SoundCloud API to create an application that allows users to find new music through a multi-genre randomizer.

Description:

I wanted to create a tool for finding new music in a partially unpredictable manner so that truly new music could be found by anyone. There are many features included in this project in the back-end and front-end. This single page application utilizes Backbone and Underscore for JavaScript features. The front-end is user oriented by providing different options for randomizing and a drop down HTML5 canvas visualization to optionally enjoy while listing to tracks.

This projects was built from several open source examples, credits of elements included in code.
