Purpose:

The purpose of the project is to utilize a SoundCloud API to create an application that allows users to find new music through a multi-genre randomizer.

Description:

I wanted to create a tool for finding new music in a partially unpredictable manner so that truly new music could be found by anyone. There are many features included in this project in the back-end and front-end. This single page application utilizes Backbone and Underscore for JavaScript features. The front-end is user oriented by providing different options for randomizing and a drop down HTML5 canvas visualization to optionally enjoy while listing to tracks.

This projects was built by forking and modifying several open source examples, credits of elements included in code.
